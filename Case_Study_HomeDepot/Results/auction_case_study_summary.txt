Auction Pricing Case Study - Step-by-Step Summary

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Dropped rows with missing CPM, impressions, sales
   - Converted date and engineered week, month, year
   - Created new metrics like revenue per impression and CPM delta

2. Feature Engineering:
   - CTR proxy (impressions / traffic)
   - Encoded category (taxonomy)

3. Model Training:
   - Used RandomForestRegressor
   - Validated model with RMSE and RÂ²

4. Interpretability:
   - Calculated Information Value (IV) using mutual information

5. Pricing Recommendation:
   - Used predicted CPM to set floor CPM at 25th percentile
   - Simulated revenue uplift from floor enforcement

6. Visualizations:
   - Time series trends (CPM, impressions)
   - Feature IV scores

7. Deliverables:
   - Cleaned Excel data
   - Python scripts
   - Presentation deck (separate file)
   - Visuals (generated manually after running scripts)
